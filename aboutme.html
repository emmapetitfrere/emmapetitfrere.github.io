      I am a voice of advocacy and truth, also known as a journalist. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Miami studying Journalism with an emphasis in Broadcast Journalism and Visual Storytelling. My graduate program has provided me with a diverse skill set in news writing, visual storytelling, web design and coding, and social media.

      During my undergraduate career, I majored in Political Science while minoring in Health Sector Management and Public Health. I have a strong interest in politics and social justice, but also have interests ranging public health to pop-culture.

      I aspire to someday use those skills as a means to be a voice for the voiceless that is never silenced. </p>
