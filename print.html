    <h2>Michael Perez: The Man Behind Miami's Art</h2>

      <p>He was always inspired by colors. As a child it was bright colors. Now as an adult, the toned down colors.
       Over the course of his career, he has been influenced by different color palettes, in phases; sometimes black and white were his preference,
       other times, it was earth tones.
      The only constant was that his preferences were constantly changing. What influenced those changes? Experiences. </p>

      <p>
        Artist Michael Perez stands by the belief that art is a way of living, and that experiences influence art.
        “As I grow older, I change, and I experience different things,” Perez said.
        “When you’re young you haven’t experienced many different things, but as you grow older you experience things,
        and they change you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        At a very young age his parents noticed his artistic abilities, and encouraged him to pursue a career in art.
         At 16, he underwent a competitive process to enroll in the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan.
         Although his parents pushed him towards his career path, he didn’t need much convincing. </p>
      </p>

	      “I acted like an artist, my friends would ride bicycles up and down the street and I would stay home painting.
        I had a little studio in my house, and I was very young,” Perez said. According to Perez, “acting like an artist,”
        was defined by not finding typical kid’s activities interesting, the clothes he chose to wear, the love of visits to the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum,
        and taking pictures wherever he went.
      </p>
      <p>
	       Born and raised in New York City, Perez was surrounded by amazing art.
         He spent most of his life and career in there before moving to Miami eight years ago,
         where he opened one of the most well-known galleries in Miami’s Art and Design District, known as Wynwood.
         Perez parallels Wynwood as an art hub similar to SoHo in New York before it became commercialized over 20 years ago.
         Perez is beginning to see the commercialization of Wynwood although it is not yet as commercialized as SoHo.
      </p>

      <p>
        	“This happens in every art district; it definitely gets in the way of the art, but art overcomes all of that.
           We’ll find another area to move into and start another art district and then the McDonalds and Louis Vuittons,
           and 7-Elevens will come after, but then we move on,” Perez said.
      </p>

      <p>
        He recalls relocating 4 different times while working in the art districts of New York City.
         “We were pushed out of the meat packing industry by Betsey Johnson, Tribeca was taken over by Louis Vuitton,
         SoHo was taken over by Linens and Things, it goes on and on and on, but art overcomes it,” Perez said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Commercialization has not only influenced the location of art, but art itself.
        Perez says that he typically paints as often as he needs to, which is typically twice a week.
        The rest of his time is handling the business aspect of art, taking care of his clients by keeping in touch and marketing.
         Perez says these are necessary duties since the rise of the internet, being that it has expanded his clientele base around the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        When painting, Perez works on multiple canvases at a time, and typically completes them in a day.
        While many artists need outside influence to motivate them while creating art, he finds no need for it.
         At times he’ll play music while painting, but many times he forgets.
         One thing is for sure, the colors continue to inspire him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Perez’s color palette is constantly changing, one thing has remained the same, his choice of subject.
         Perez is most known for his works that depict women’s faces.
         “I happen to like the shape of a face, and I like the way I can work the colors of the hair to do different things
         and the way the eye stares at you is very important to me; the eyes give access to the soul,” Perez said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perez’s proclivity to creating art of women’s faces is not influenced by women he comes in contact with on a daily basis.
        In fact, he admits that he has never seen a woman that he felt inspired to depict.
      </p>

      <p>
        	“It’s more than a face, it’s really cool. I used to sit in front of
          the Museum of Modern Art when I was really young and sell my faces,” said Perez.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the age of 17, he would sell his work on the New York City streets for about $300 a piece.
        Little did he know, his faces would take him places.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2001, Perez painted his most important face. The night of the September 11th terror attacks,
         he received a phone call inviting him on the NBC Today Show to paint live.
         The painting, without surprise, was of a woman’s face.
         The American Flag strategically placed as her hair,
         and a reflection of the Twin Towers in her eyes as a tear streams down her face.
         Perez titled the piece “America the Beautiful.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Perez describes the piece of art as a sign of hope to all.
        The piece helped raise thousands of dollars to support heroes, like the many 9/11 responders,
         who risked their lives every day to keep communities safe.
        The painting was later placed in the headquarters of the Miami Fire Rescue
        to honor those who traveled from Miami during the terror attacks to respond to those in need in New York City.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pieces like Perez’s“America the Beautiful,” serve to provide hope.
         “I feel responsible for making the world better, because art is very important with
          all the chaos that we’re going through in the world,” Perez said.
        According to him, art has always been influential to the world throughout history,
         from Hitler to Rome, to Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.
         Perez believes art’s role in the world is to keep people happy in the midst of it all.
         “I’m doing my job,” he says.
